### Hi there 👋

I am a software engineer with a diverse background ranging from developing interactive browser-based programs to pioneering efforts within the niche community of NYC/four-wall handball. A natural leader with a passionate inclination towards critical thinking, I strive to learn and build creative but effective applications to bridge the gap between functionality and innovation.
